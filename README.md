# Connect Four

A web-based version of the classic **Connect Four** game built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Players take turns dropping colored discs into a 7-column, 6-row grid. The first to connect four of their discs wins!

This project focuses on clean UI, responsive design, and modular code structure using modern frontend tools.
